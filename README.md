# NumericalMethods2
#### Numerical and iterative schemes (mostly Jupyter Notebooks)
This repository is a collection of some of my assignments and projects for the lecture Numerical Methods 2. 
In this lecture we covered numerical iterative approaches to solve large (sparse) linear systems of equations. 
Here are some implementations of the algorithms discussed
